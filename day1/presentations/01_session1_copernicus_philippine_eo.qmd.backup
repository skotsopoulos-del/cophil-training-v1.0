# Sentinel-1: SAR Mission {background-color="#0f766e"}

## Sentinel-1 Overview

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
**Mission Configuration (2025)**

- **Sensor:** C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar
- **Satellites:** 1A, **1C (operational 2025)**
- **Orbit:** Polar sun-synchronous
- **All-weather, day/night capability**
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](images/sentinel1_satellite.jpg){width="100%"}
:::
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Key Advantage:** Penetrates clouds and works at night
:::

::: {.notes}
Sentinel-1 is a radar imaging mission with C-band SAR enabling all-weather, day-and-night observations unaffected by clouds - crucial in tropical regions like the Philippines.
:::

## Sentinel-1 Technical Specifications

| **Parameter** | **Value** |
|--------------|-----------|
| **Sensor Type** | C-band SAR (5.405 GHz) |
| **Revisit Time** | 6-12 days (constellation) |
| **Swath Width** | 250 km (IW mode) |
| **Spatial Resolution** | 5m × 20m (IW mode) |
| **Polarization** | VV + VH or HH + HV |
| **Orbit** | 693 km altitude |

::: {.notes}
Sentinel-1 operates in Interferometric Wide (IW) mode with ~5m by 20m spatial resolution. With two satellites, the revisit cycle is 6 days globally. Note: Sentinel-1B became inoperative in 2022; Sentinel-1C launched in 2024 to restore 6-day revisit.
:::

## SAR: How It Works

![](images/sar_principle.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

::: {.incremental}
1. Satellite sends **microwave pulses** to Earth
2. Signal **reflects** from surface
3. Sensor measures **backscatter intensity**
4. Different surfaces = different backscatter
:::

::: {.notes}
SAR satellites send microwave signals and measure the backscatter. Water appears dark (low backscatter), urban areas appear bright (strong backscatter), and vegetation shows moderate backscatter.
:::

## Sentinel-1 Polarization

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**What is Polarization?**

- Orientation of radar wave
- VV: Vertical send/receive
- VH: Vertical send/Horizontal receive
- HH: Horizontal send/receive
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Applications**

- **VV:** Good for water/flood mapping
- **VH:** Sensitive to volume scattering (vegetation)
- **VV/VH Ratio:** Discriminates surface types
:::
:::

![](images/polarization_comparison.jpg){fig-align="center" width="60%"}

::: {.notes}
Sentinel-1 IW mode over land typically provides VV and VH polarizations. Different polarizations are sensitive to different surface characteristics.
:::

## Backscatter Characteristics by Target

| **Surface Type** | **Backscatter** | **Appearance** | **Reason** |
|------------------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| **Water (smooth)** | Very Low | Dark/Black | Specular reflection |
| **Urban/Buildings** | Very High | Bright White | Corner reflectors |
| **Forest/Vegetation** | Medium-High | Gray | Volume scattering |
| **Agricultural Fields** | Medium | Light Gray | Surface roughness |
| **Bare Soil (dry)** | Low-Medium | Dark Gray | Smooth surface |
| **Bare Soil (wet)** | Medium | Medium Gray | Increased dielectric |

::: {.fragment}
**Key Insight:** Water appears dark, structures appear bright - the basis for flood mapping!
:::

::: {.notes}
Understanding backscatter is crucial for interpreting SAR imagery. Smooth surfaces (water) reflect signals away = dark. Rough surfaces and structures reflect signals back = bright.
:::

## Sentinel-1 Imaging Modes

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Interferometric Wide Swath (IW)**
- **250 km swath**
- 5m × 20m resolution
- **Default over land**
- Philippine standard mode

**Extra Wide Swath (EW)**
- 400 km swath
- 20m × 40m resolution
- Maritime/polar regions
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Strip Map (SM)**
- 80 km swath
- 5m × 5m resolution
- Emergency response
- High detail needed

**Wave (WV)**
- Ocean waves
- Not used for land
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
Interferometric Wide (IW) mode is used over land and provides the best balance of resolution and coverage. All Philippine acquisitions use IW mode.
:::

## Sentinel-1 Data Products

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Level-1 GRD (Ground Range Detected)**

- Multi-looked (reduced speckle)
- Projected to ground range
- **Most commonly used**
- Faster to process
- Smaller file size
- **Applications:**
  - Change detection
  - Classification
  - Flood mapping
  - Ship detection
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Level-1 SLC (Single Look Complex)**

- Preserves phase information
- Complex-valued pixels
- Required for InSAR
- Larger files
- **Applications:**
  - Ground deformation
  - Interferometry
  - Coherence analysis
  - Subsidence monitoring
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
For most applications including flood mapping and land cover, GRD products are sufficient. SLC products are needed for advanced interferometric applications like volcano monitoring.
:::

## GRD vs SLC - Which to Choose?

| **Factor** | **GRD** | **SLC** |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Use Case** | Most applications | Interferometry only |
| **Processing** | Ready to use | Complex processing |
| **File Size** | ~1 GB | ~4 GB |
| **Speckle** | Reduced | Full speckle |
| **Phase** | Not preserved | Preserved |
| **Typical User** | Most analysts | Advanced specialists |

::: {.fragment}
**For this training and most Philippine applications: Use GRD**
:::

::: {.notes}
Unless you specifically need interferometry (earthquake/volcano deformation), always use GRD products. They're easier to work with and sufficient for 90% of applications.
:::

## Sentinel-1 Pre-Processing "Under the Hood" {background-color="#1e40af"}

::: {.callout-note}
## What Happens Before You See SAR Data?

For this training, we use **pre-processed Sentinel-1 GRD data**. Here's what happens "under the hood":
:::

**S1 Processing Pipeline:**

1. **GRD Download** → Raw ground-range detected amplitude
2. **Radiometric Calibration** → Convert to backscatter coefficient (σ⁰)
3. **Terrain Correction (RTC)** → Remove topographic distortions using DEM
4. **Speckle Filtering** → Reduce SAR noise (Lee, Refined Lee, or Gamma-MAP filters)
5. **Conversion to dB** → γ⁰ (gamma-naught) in decibels for visual interpretation
6. **Tiling/Clipping** → Extract area of interest

::: {.fragment}
**For Day 3 flood mapping labs:** We provide analysis-ready patches with these steps already applied
:::

::: {.notes}
**P0 IMPROVEMENT APPLIED:** Explicit S1 pre-processing assumptions before U-Net flood lab (Day 3).

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Participants need to understand what "analysis-ready" means
- RTC removes terrain effects - critical in mountainous Philippines
- Gamma-naught (γ⁰) in dB is standard for land applications
- Speckle filtering is essential but can blur edges
- These steps are computationally intensive - we pre-process for efficiency

**Timing:** 3 minutes

**Transition:** "Now let's look at Sentinel-2 optical data..."
:::

- Highlights crop moisture
- Soil moisture visible

**SWIR-NIR-Red (Burn/Fire)**
- **RGB:** B12-B8-B4
- **Active fires appear BRIGHT**
- Burn scars dark purple
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
Different band combinations highlight different features. False Color (NIR-Red-Green) is the most common for vegetation mapping - healthy vegetation appears bright red.
:::

---

## Live Demo: Sentinel-2 Data {background-color="#1e40af"}

### Copernicus Browser Demonstration

**We'll explore:**

- Finding cloud-free Sentinel-2 imagery
- Band combinations (True Color, False Color, SWIR)
- NDVI vegetation index
- Time-series comparison (deforestation/urban growth)

::: {.notes}
**Timing:** 5 minutes

**Demo Steps:**
1. Open Copernicus Browser
2. Navigate to Palawan or Metro Manila
3. Select Sentinel-2 L2A (atmospherically corrected)
4. Filter by cloud cover (<20%)
5. Show True Color RGB (B4-B3-B2)
6. Switch to False Color (B8-B4-B3) - vegetation is RED
7. Show SWIR composite (B12-B8-B4) - good for fires/moisture
8. Calculate NDVI: (B8-B4)/(B8+B4)
9. Use time slider to show change (e.g., deforestation, urban expansion)

**Key Teaching Points:**
- 13 bands provide rich information
- Different band combinations highlight different features
- L2A data is analysis-ready
- 10m resolution excellent for detailed mapping
- 5-day repeat increases cloud-free acquisition chances

**Common Questions:**
- "Which bands should I use?" - Depends on application (we'll cover in Day 2)
- "What about clouds?" - **Use Scene Classification Layer (SCL)** - Session 4 topic

**P0 IMPROVEMENT - SCL vs QA60:** We'll use **SCL masking** (not QA60) in Session 4 for better cloud AND shadow removal. SCL classes: clouds (low/medium/high prob), cirrus, cloud shadows, snow/ice - much more comprehensive than basic QA60 bitmasks.
:::

# Sentinel-1 vs Sentinel-2 {background-color="#0f766e"}

## Complementary Capabilities

| **Aspect** | **Sentinel-1** | **Sentinel-2** |
{{ ... }}
|------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Sensor Type** | Radar (SAR) | Optical (MSI) |
| **Weather** | All-weather | Cloud-affected |
| **Time** | Day & night | Daytime only |
| **Resolution** | 5m × 20m | 10m / 20m / 60m |
| **Revisit** | 6-12 days | 5 days |
| **Bands** | Polarizations (2) | Spectral bands (13) |
| **Best For** | Water, structure, moisture | Vegetation, land cover, color |

::: {.callout-tip}
## S1 Flood Mapping Tip

**VV polarization shows dark water** (low backscatter from smooth surfaces)

**Best practice:** Compare **pre-event vs post-event** delta for reliability

**Synergy:** Pair S1 (flood extent through clouds) with S2 (vegetation damage when clear) for complete impact assessment
:::

::: {.notes}
Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 are complementary. SAR penetrates clouds and works at night, while optical provides rich spectral information about surface properties.

**MICRO-EDIT APPLIED:** Added S1 vs S2 flood tip to set up Day 3 logic - VV dark water, pre/post comparison, and S1+S2 synergy.
:::

## Synergistic Use Cases

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Flood Mapping**

- **S1:** Detect water extent (through clouds)
- **S2:** Assess damage to vegetation/crops (when clear)
- **Combined:** Complete flood impact assessment
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Forest Monitoring**

- **S1:** Detect structural changes, biomass
- **S2:** Identify tree species, health
- **Combined:** Comprehensive forest mapping
:::
:::

![](images/s1_s2_synergy.jpg){fig-align="center" width="60%"}

::: {.notes}
Using both missions together provides more complete information. After a typhoon, S1 maps floods under clouds while S2 assesses vegetation damage where it's clear.

## Operational Cautions {background-color="#dc2626"}

::: {.callout-warning}
## "Don't Do This" - Common Pitfalls

**Quality & Governance additions** to prevent common mistakes:
:::

**Model Applicability:**
- ❌ **Don't** apply a Palawan RF land cover model to Mindanao without re-sampling
  - Why: Different climate, vegetation types, seasonality
  - Do: Collect local training samples from Mindanao
- ❌ **Don't** use un-calibrated SAR (digital numbers only)
  - Why: Meaningless for quantitative analysis
  - Do: Always calibrate to σ⁰ or γ⁰ in dB

**Processing Assumptions:**
- ❌ **Don't** skip terrain correction (RTC) for SAR in mountainous areas
  - Why: Topographic distortions create false changes
  - Do: Apply RTC using SRTM or better DEM
- ❌ **Don't** mix Sentinel-2 processing baselines without harmonization
  - Why: DN offset of 1000 after Jan 2022 breaks time series
  - Do: Use HARMONIZED collections in GEE

**Evaluation:**
- ❌ **Don't** train and test on the same tile/province
  - Why: Inflated accuracy, poor generalization
  - Do: Geographic hold-out (different tiles/provinces for test)

::: {.notes}
**P2 IMPROVEMENT APPLIED:** Operational cautions slide with "don't do this" examples.

These are real mistakes participants WILL make without explicit warnings. One slide can save hours of debugging and poor results.
