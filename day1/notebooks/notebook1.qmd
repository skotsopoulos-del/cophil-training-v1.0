## Session 3 Hands-On Notebook

This notebook accompanies **Session 3: Python for Geospatial Data**. You'll learn to work with vector data using GeoPandas and raster data using Rasterio.

### Learning Objectives

By completing this notebook, you will:

- Load and visualize vector data with GeoPandas
- Work with different vector formats (Shapefiles, GeoJSON, GeoPackage)
- Perform coordinate reference system transformations
- Read and process raster data with Rasterio
- Extract band information and metadata
- Visualize multi-band imagery
- Apply the concepts to Philippine data

---
