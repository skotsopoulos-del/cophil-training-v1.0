## ðŸ“— Notebook 2: Advanced Cloud Masking (P0 Best Practices)

### What You'll Learn

**ðŸ†• P0 IMPROVEMENT:** This notebook implements the expert-recommended cloud masking improvements:

- **Scene Classification Layer (SCL) masking**
  - Detects clouds AND shadows (QA60 misses shadows!)
  - 12-class comprehensive classification
  - Better for NDVI time series and land cover

- **s2cloudless integration**
  - Most accurate ML-based cloud detection
  - Adjustable probability thresholds
  - Production-grade quality

- **Comparative analysis**
  - Visual comparison: QA60 vs SCL vs s2cloudless
  - When to use each method
  - Performance trade-offs

- **Export templates**
  - Optimized for ML training data
  - Batch export workflows
  - Sample point extraction

### When to Use This Notebook

âœ… **After completing Notebook 1**
âœ… **For operational/production work**
âœ… **When QA60 results have "ghost" clouds or shadows**
âœ… **For ML training data preparation**
âœ… **For NDVI time series analysis**

### Open in Google Colab

::: {.callout-note}
## Notebook 2 Coming Soon
The advanced SCL cloud masking notebook is currently under development. For now, use Notebook 1 which covers all essential GEE concepts including QA60 cloud masking.
:::

**Why Notebook 2 (When Available):**

## Key Concepts Covered

### Earth Engine Architecture

```python
# Basic Earth Engine workflow
import ee
ee.Initialize()

# Define area of interest
philippines = ee.Geometry.Rectangle([116.0, 4.0, 127.0, 21.0])

# Access Sentinel-2 collection
collection = ee.ImageCollection('COPERNICUS/S2_SR_HARMONIZED') \
    .filterBounds(philippines) \
    .filterDate('2024-01-01', '2024-12-31') \
    .filter(ee.Filter.lt('CLOUDY_PIXEL_PERCENTAGE', 20))

# Create composite
composite = collection.median()

# Calculate NDVI
ndvi = composite.normalizedDifference(['B8', 'B4'])
```

### Interactive Mapping with geemap

```python
import geemap

# Create interactive map
Map = geemap.Map()
Map.centerObject(philippines, 6)

# Add layers
Map.addLayer(composite, {'bands': ['B4', 'B3', 'B2'], 'min': 0, 'max': 3000}, 'True Color')
Map.addLayer(ndvi, {'min': 0, 'max': 1, 'palette': ['red', 'yellow', 'green']}, 'NDVI')

Map
```

## Common Errors & Solutions

### Error: "Please set project ID"
**Cause:** Earth Engine not authenticated

**Solution:**
```python
ee.Authenticate()  # Follow prompts
ee.Initialize()
```

### Error: "User memory limit exceeded"
**Solution:** Reduce spatial or temporal scope, increase scale parameter

### Error: "Too many concurrent aggregations"
**Solution:** Add `.limit()` to reduce collection size

See the [FAQ](../../resources/faq.qmd#earth-engine-issues) for more troubleshooting help.
