### Technique Selection Matrix

::: {.callout-tip}
## Decision Tree: Which Technique to Use?

**Question 1: What's your prediction goal?**

**A. Single label per image** → Image Classification
- Small dataset (<1K): Transfer learning / foundation model
- Large dataset (>5K): Train CNN or use foundation model

**B. Pixel-wise labels** → Semantic Segmentation
- Best: **U-Net** or fine-tuned foundation model
- Applications: Flood extent, land cover, vegetation

**C. Bounding boxes** → Object Detection
- Use: YOLO, SSD, or DETR
- Applications: Buildings, vehicles, ships

**D. Time series** → Sequence Modeling
- Best: **LSTM** or Transformer
- Applications: Drought, crop phenology, change detection

**E. Tabular features** → Traditional ML
- Best: **Random Forest** or XGBoost
- Advantages: Interpretable, fast

**Question 2: How much labeled data?**

- **<100:** Foundation model fine-tuning
- **100-1,000:** Transfer learning + augmentation
- **1,000-10,000:** Smaller networks or traditional ML
- **>10,000:** Full deep learning

**Question 3: Need to explain predictions?**

- **Yes (high-stakes):** Use XAI or simpler models
- **No (research only):** Any model

## Part 2: Best Practices for Operational Deployment (30 minutes)

### The Data-Centric AI Mindset

**Traditional (Model-Centric):**
- Get any data → focus on model architecture → tune hyperparameters
- Result: Marginal gains, high effort

**Data-Centric Approach:**
- Systematically improve data quality → fix labeling errors → representative sampling
- Result: Larger gains, sustainable performance

::: {.callout-important}
## Andrew Ng's 10-Minute Rule

Before spending 10 hours optimizing your model:

1. **Spend 10 minutes** examining training data
2. **Look for:**
   - Labeling inconsistencies
   - Missing edge cases
   - Class imbalance
   - Regional bias (e.g., all Luzon samples)
3. **Fix data issues first**
4. **Then** improve model

**Case Study:** Philippine flood model improved 78% → 91% accuracy by:
- Fixing 50 mislabeled samples
- Adding 100 Mindanao samples (was Luzon-only)
- No model changes!
:::

### Validation Strategy Best Practices

**1. Temporal Validation for Time Series**

```python
# WRONG: Random split (data leakage!)
train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# RIGHT: Temporal split
train_end = '2020-12-31'
X_train = X[X.index <= train_end]
X_test = X[X.index > train_end]
```

**2. Spatial Cross-Validation**
- Train on Luzon → Test on Visayas/Mindanao
- Ensures model generalizes to unseen locations

**3. Stratified Sampling**
- Proportional class representation
- Diverse geographic locations
- Seasonal variations included

### Handling Class Imbalance

**Problem:** 95% non-flood, 5% flood pixels → Model predicts all non-flood → 95% accuracy but useless!

**Solutions:**

**1. Weighted Loss**
```python
class_weights = {0: 1.0, 1: 19.0}  # non-flood : flood
model.compile(loss='weighted_cross_entropy', class_weight=class_weights)
```

**2. Oversampling/Undersampling**
- Oversample minority (flood)
- Undersample majority (non-flood)
- Use SMOTE for synthetic samples

**3. Better Metrics**
- Use F1-score, IoU, precision/recall
- Focus on minority class performance

:::

### Model Monitoring & Maintenance

**Models degrade over time due to:**
- **Concept drift:** Patterns change (climate change, urbanization)
- **Data drift:** Input distribution shifts (new sensor, preprocessing)
- **Label drift:** Definition changes (taxonomy update)

**Solution: Continuous Monitoring**

```python
def monitor_model_performance():
    current_metrics = evaluate_on_latest_data()
    
    if current_metrics['accuracy'] < baseline - 0.05:
        alert_team("Model performance degraded!")
        trigger_retraining()
    
    log_metrics(current_metrics)
```

**Retraining Schedule:**
- **Disaster models:** After each major event
- **Agricultural models:** Quarterly (seasonal shifts)
- **Land cover models:** Annually (gradual changes)
