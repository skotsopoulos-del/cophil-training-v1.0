## Part 1: Time Series in Earth Observation (20 minutes)

### Why Time Series Matter

Earth observation data is inherently **temporal** - we observe the same locations repeatedly over time. This temporal dimension unlocks powerful insights:

**Static Analysis (Single Date):**
- Land cover classification
- Feature detection
- Snapshot assessments

**Time Series Analysis (Multi-Date):**
- Vegetation phenology and growth cycles
- Drought onset and recovery
- Crop yield forecasting
- Deforestation detection
- Seasonal pattern analysis
- Climate change trend identification

::: {.callout-tip}
## Time Series: The Fourth Dimension of EO

While CNNs excel at extracting spatial patterns from individual satellite images, **LSTMs excel at extracting temporal patterns** from sequences of observations. Together, they form powerful tools for spatiotemporal analysis.
:::

### Common EO Time Series

**Vegetation Indices:**
- **NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index):** Tracks vegetation health, crop growth stages, drought stress
- **EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index):** Better for high-biomass areas like tropical forests
- **SAVI (Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index):** Reduces soil background effects

**Backscatter Time Series (SAR):**
- **VV, VH polarization:** Changes indicate flooding, harvest, vegetation structure changes
- **Coherence:** Measures surface stability over time

**Biophysical Parameters:**
- **LAI (Leaf Area Index):** Crop canopy development
- **FPAR (Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation):** Productivity indicator
- **LST (Land Surface Temperature):** Heat stress, urban heat island

**Precipitation and Climate Variables:**
- Rainfall accumulation
- Soil moisture
- Temperature anomalies

### Philippine Context: Seasonal Patterns

**Mindanao Agricultural Cycles:**

The Philippines exhibits distinct seasonal patterns critical for agricultural monitoring:

**Dry Season (November - April):**
- Lower NDVI values in rain-fed areas
- Reduced soil moisture
- Increased drought risk in Mindanao

**Wet Season (May - October):**
- Peak NDVI during vegetative growth
- Rice planting and growing seasons
- Flood risk in typhoon-prone areas

**El Niño/La Niña Impacts:**
- **El Niño:** Prolonged dry conditions, delayed planting, reduced yields
- **La Niña:** Enhanced rainfall, potential flooding, pest outbreaks

::: {.callout-note}
## Mindanao Case Study

Bukidnon and South Cotabato provinces in Mindanao are major agricultural regions producing:
- Corn (maize)
- Rice
- Pineapple
- Coffee
- Sugarcane

These areas experienced severe drought during the **2015-2016 El Niño**, causing significant crop losses. Predicting drought conditions 1-3 months in advance enables early interventions (irrigation, crop insurance, food security planning).
:::

### Applications for LSTM Time Series Forecasting

- **Output:** Predicted flood probability
- **Benefit:** Disaster preparedness

**4. Land Cover Change Detection**
- **Input:** Multi-temporal optical and SAR data
- **Output:** Change probability, anomaly detection
- **Benefit:** Deforestation monitoring, illegal land use detection

**5. Phenology Monitoring**
- **Input:** NDVI/EVI time series across growing season
- **Output:** Predicted crop stage, harvest date
- **Benefit:** Precision agriculture, crop insurance

## Part 2: Recurrent Neural Networks and Their Limitations (20 minutes)

### Why Standard Neural Networks Fail for Sequences

**Feedforward Neural Networks** (including CNNs) have a critical limitation: they assume inputs are **independent**.

**Problem with Sequential Data:**
- Each input depends on previous inputs
- Context matters: The meaning of today's NDVI value depends on the trend over the past weeks
- Fixed input size: How do you handle variable-length sequences?

**Example:** Predicting next month's vegetation health

A feedforward network treats each month independently:
- March NDVI → Prediction (no memory)
- April NDVI → Prediction (no memory of March)

But we know:
- If NDVI has been declining for 3 months, drought is likely worsening
- If NDVI declined then recovered, conditions improved

**Solution:** Networks that maintain **memory** of previous inputs.

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

**Key Idea:** Add a **feedback loop** so the network remembers previous inputs.

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    X1[Input t-1] --> H1[Hidden State]
    H1 --> O1[Output t-1]
    H1 -.->|Memory| H2[Hidden State]
    X2[Input t] --> H2
    H2 --> O2[Output t]
    H2 -.->|Memory| H3[Hidden State]
    X3[Input t+1] --> H3
    H3 --> O3[Output t+1]

    style H1 fill:#4A90E2
    style H2 fill:#4A90E2
    style H3 fill:#4A90E2
```

**How RNNs Work:**

At each time step `t`:
1. Receive input `x_t` (e.g., current month's NDVI)
2. Combine with previous hidden state `h_{t-1}` (memory)
3. Compute new hidden state `h_t`
4. Produce output `y_t`
5. Pass `h_t` to next time step

**Mathematical Formulation:**
$$
h_t = \text{tanh}(W_{hh} \cdot h_{t-1} + W_{xh} \cdot x_t + b_h)
$$
$$
y_t = W_{hy} \cdot h_t + b_y
$$

**RNN Advantages:**
- Handles variable-length sequences
- Maintains memory across time steps
- Shares weights across time (parameter efficiency)

### The Vanishing Gradient Problem

**Critical Flaw of Standard RNNs:**

When training on long sequences (e.g., 24 months of NDVI data), gradients become extremely small as they propagate backward through time.

**Why This Happens:**

During backpropagation through time, gradients are multiplied repeatedly:
$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial h_1} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial h_T} \cdot \frac{\partial h_T}{\partial h_{T-1}} \cdot \ldots \cdot \frac{\partial h_2}{\partial h_1}
$$

If each derivative term is < 1, the product shrinks exponentially.

**Consequences:**
- **Vanishing gradients:** Network cannot learn long-term dependencies (e.g., drought conditions from 6 months ago)
- **Exploding gradients:** Less common, but gradients can also grow exponentially

**Impact on EO Applications:**

Imagine predicting drought in August based on:
- Recent data (July): RNN learns this easily
- Medium-term data (April-June): Partially learned
- Long-term data (January-March): **Lost due to vanishing gradients**

But the January-March dry season conditions are critical for August drought prediction!

::: {.callout-tip}
## 🎯 Mini-Challenge 1: Calculate Gradient Decay

**Task:** Calculate how many time steps it takes for a gradient of 0.9 to shrink below 0.01.

**Formula:** $0.9^n < 0.01$

**Solve for n:** How many steps?

**Interpretation:** What does this mean for analyzing a full year (12 months) of NDVI data with a standard RNN?

*Hint: Use logarithms or trial-and-error in Python*

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

$n = \frac{\log(0.01)}{\log(0.9)} \approx 44$ time steps

**Meaning:** A standard RNN can only effectively learn patterns from the most recent ~44 time steps. For monthly data, that's less than 4 years. For 10-day composites, less than 15 months. **This is why LSTMs are essential for long-term EO analysis!**

</details>
:::

## Vanishing Gradient Demonstration

In the interactive notebook, you'll visualize:
- Gradient magnitude decay over 50 time steps
- How standard RNN fails to learn dependencies beyond ~10 steps
- Why this prevents accurate long-term forecasting

## Part 3: LSTM Architecture - The Solution (30 minutes)

### What is an LSTM?

**Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks were designed specifically to solve the vanishing gradient problem.

**Key Innovation:** Replace simple hidden state with a **memory cell** controlled by learnable **gates**.

**LSTM Advantages:**
- Learn long-term dependencies (100+ time steps)
- Selective memory: Remember important information, forget irrelevant
- Gradient flow preserved through time

### LSTM Cell Structure

An LSTM cell has:
- **Cell State (C_t):** Long-term memory "conveyor belt"
- **Hidden State (h_t):** Short-term memory and output
- **Three Gates:** Control information flow

```{mermaid}
flowchart TB
    subgraph LSTM["LSTM Cell at time t"]
        Input[Input x_t]
        PrevH[Previous h_{t-1}]
        PrevC[Previous C_{t-1}]

    end

    style FG fill:#E74C3C
    style IG fill:#3498DB
    style OG fill:#2ECC71
    style NewC fill:#F39C12
    style NewH fill:#9B59B6
```

### The Three Gates Explained

**1. Forget Gate**

**Purpose:** Decide what information to discard from cell state

**Question:** "Should I forget old information?"

**Example:** Dry season ended, so forget drought stress patterns

**Equation:**
$$
f_t = \sigma(W_f \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)
$$

Output: 0 (forget) to 1 (keep) for each memory dimension

**2. Input Gate**

**Purpose:** Decide what new information to add to cell state

**Question:** "What new information should I remember?"

**Example:** Wet season started, remember increasing rainfall pattern

**Equations:**
$$
i_t = \sigma(W_i \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)
$$
$$
\tilde{C}_t = \text{tanh}(W_C \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C)
$$

- `i_t`: How much to add (0 to 1)
- `C_tilde_t`: Candidate values to add

**3. Output Gate**

**Purpose:** Decide what to output based on cell state

**Question:** "What should I output this time step?"

**Example:** Output current drought risk based on accumulated evidence

**Equation:**
$$
o_t = \sigma(W_o \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o)
$$
$$
h_t = o_t \cdot \text{tanh}(C_t)
$$

### Cell State Update

**Step 1: Forget old information**
$$
C_t = f_t \cdot C_{t-1}
$$

**Step 2: Add new information**
$$
C_t = C_t + i_t \cdot \tilde{C}_t
$$

**Combined:**
$$
C_t = f_t \cdot C_{t-1} + i_t \cdot \tilde{C}_t
$$

### Why LSTMs Solve Vanishing Gradients

**Key Insight:** Cell state acts as a **gradient highway**

**Standard RNN:** Gradient multiplied by weight matrix at each step → decay

**LSTM:** Gradient flows through cell state with only **element-wise operations** (addition, multiplication by gate values)

Since gate values are learned and can be close to 1, gradients flow backward through time with minimal decay.

**Result:**
- Learn dependencies over 100+ time steps
- Remember important events from months ago
- Forget irrelevant short-term fluctuations

::: {.callout-note}
## 💭 Think-Through Discussion

**Question:** In drought monitoring for Mindanao agriculture, what kind of information might the **forget gate** discard and what might the **input gate** preserve?

**Consider:**
- Seasonal patterns (wet season → dry season transitions)
- Short-term weather noise vs. long-term climate trends
- El Niño indicators appearing months before drought onset
- Normal year-to-year NDVI fluctuations vs. anomalies

**Reflection:** How would the gates behave differently when processing:
1. A typical seasonal NDVI decline (expected)
2. An anomalous drought event (unexpected)

*Discuss with your peers or reflect on this in the notebook exercises*
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Interactive Visualization

In the demo notebook, you'll manipulate gate values and see:
- How forget gate controls memory retention
- How input gate decides what to memorize
- How output gate controls predictions
- Cell state evolution over a 24-month NDVI sequence

## Part 4: LSTM for EO Time Series (20 minutes)

### LSTM Network Architecture for Forecasting

**Typical LSTM Setup for EO:**

```{mermaid}
flowchart TB
    Input[Input Sequence<br/>NDVI for 12 months]

    LSTM1[LSTM Layer 1<br/>64 units]
    LSTM2[LSTM Layer 2<br/>32 units]

    Dense1[Dense Layer<br/>16 units, ReLU]
    Dense2[Dense Layer<br/>1 unit, linear]

    Output[Output<br/>Predicted NDVI month 13]

    Input --> LSTM1
    LSTM1 --> LSTM2
    LSTM2 --> Dense1
    Dense1 --> Dense2
    Dense2 --> Output

    style LSTM1 fill:#4A90E2
    style LSTM2 fill:#4A90E2
    style Output fill:#2ECC71
```

**Components:**
- **Input Layer:** Sequence of observations (e.g., 12 months of NDVI)
- **LSTM Layers:** Extract temporal patterns (1-2 layers typical)
- **Dense Layers:** Map LSTM output to prediction
- **Output Layer:** Predicted value(s)

### Input Data Preparation

**Sequence Creation (Sliding Window):**

Given monthly NDVI data from 2015-2021, create training sequences:

**Lookback Window:** 12 months (1 year)
**Forecast Horizon:** 1 month ahead

**Example:**
- Sequence 1: [Jan 2015, Feb 2015, ..., Dec 2015] → Predict Jan 2016
- Sequence 2: [Feb 2015, Mar 2015, ..., Jan 2016] → Predict Feb 2016
- Sequence 3: [Mar 2015, Apr 2015, ..., Feb 2016] → Predict Mar 2016
- ...and so on

**Result:** Hundreds or thousands of training sequences from a multi-year time series

**Multivariate Inputs:**

LSTMs can use multiple features per time step:
- NDVI (vegetation health)
- Rainfall (water availability)
- Temperature (heat stress)
- Soil moisture
- Previous year same month (seasonal context)

**Input Shape:** `(samples, time_steps, features)`

Example: `(5000, 12, 4)` = 5000 sequences, 12 months lookback, 4 features

### Training Process

**1. Data Splitting:**
- Training set: 2015-2019 (80%)
- Validation set: 2020 (10%)
- Test set: 2021 (10%)

**Important:** Use temporal splits (not random) to avoid data leakage

**2. Normalization:**
Scale features to [0, 1] or standardize to mean=0, std=1

**3. Model Compilation:**
- **Loss function:** Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression
- **Optimizer:** Adam (adaptive learning rate)
- **Metrics:** RMSE, MAE

**4. Training:**
- Batch size: 32-128
- Epochs: 50-200 (with early stopping)
- Monitor validation loss to prevent overfitting

**5. Evaluation:**
- Test set predictions vs. actual values
- Visualize time series predictions
- Calculate error metrics

### Hyperparameters to Tune

| Parameter | Description | Typical Range |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **LSTM units** | Hidden state dimensionality | 32-256 per layer |
| **Number of layers** | Depth of LSTM stack | 1-3 |
| **Lookback window** | How many time steps to use | 6-24 months |
| **Dropout** | Regularization to prevent overfitting | 0.1-0.3 |
| **Learning rate** | Optimization step size | 0.0001-0.01 |
| **Batch size** | Samples per gradient update | 32-128 |
